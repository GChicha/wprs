## Contribution process

### Pre-commit Hooks

Enable pre-commit hooks to check tests and formatting with `ln -sf ../hooks/
.git/hooks`. This will also be run by CI tests, but the hook will save you a
round-trip.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
